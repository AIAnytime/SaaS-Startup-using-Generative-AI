hashlib: Provides interfaces to secure hash algorithms. It is used to generate hash values of
data. In our case, we will use hashlib to hash user information before storing them in the
database for security purposes.
• sqlite3: This library provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate
server process and allows us to access the database using SQL commands. We will use it to
create and manage a database to store user information.
• stripe: This is a third-party library that provides a Python client for the Stripe API, which
allows us to handle payments in our application. We will use it to process payments made by
users through our application.
